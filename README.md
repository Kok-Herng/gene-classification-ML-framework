# A Proposed Machine Learning Framework for The Classification of Genes Associated with Abiotic Stress-Resistant Traits in Rice
This research is the Final Year Project for my BSc in Bioinformatics. For this research, I will be looking at machine learning-based predictive model in classification genes and SNPs that are related to abiotic stress-resistant traits in rice.<br/><br/>

**Research Aim and Objective** <br/>
This study aims to establish the predictive model for the classification of genes associated with abiotic stress-resistant traits in rice. Specifically, the objectives of this study are:
- To construct the supervised machine learning-based predictive model of causal gene that are related to abiotic stress-resistant traits.
- To validate the accuracy and efficiency of the predictive models.<br/><br/>

Rice (*Oryza sativa*) data will be collected from MARDI as well as public databases, knowledge sources, and scientific literature.<br/><br/>

**Proposed Solution/Methodology**
- A predictive model will be constructed using supervised learning. Convolutional neural network (CNN), autoencoder, random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression will be studied in this project.
- Feature selection will also be carried out in order to obtain more accurate prioritization. Recursive feature elimination (RFE), Correlation-based feature selection (CFS) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), are the methods that will be tested in this project.<br/><br/>

**Research Significances**
- The ML framework is highly valuable for biologists, geneticists, rice breeders as well as agriculture sectors for the development of new and improved rice varieties.
- It will assist in resource optimization and cost reduction in the field of selection-assisted reproduction (MAS).
- Genome editing can be utilized through the development of a one-stop digital platform.
