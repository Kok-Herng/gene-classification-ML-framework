# Predictive Model for The Classification of Genes Associated with Abiotic Stress-resistant Traits in Rice Using Supervised Machine Learning
This research is the Final Year Project for my BSc in Bioinformatics. For this research, I will be developing machine learning-based predictive models in classifying genes that are related to abiotic stress-resistant traits in rice.<br/><br/>

<h2>Research Aim and Objective</h2>
The aim of this study is to establish the predictive model for the classification of genes associated with abiotic stress-resistant traits in rice. Inline with this, there are 3 specific objectives which are:
- To construct a training dataset.
- To develop a supervised machine learning-based predictive model.
- To validate the accuracy and efficiency of the predictive models.<br/><br/>

Rice (*Oryza sativa*) data will be collected from MARDI as well as public databases, knowledge sources, and scientific literature.<br/><br/>
