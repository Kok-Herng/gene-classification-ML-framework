# Predictive Model for The Classification of Genes Associated with Abiotic Stress-resistant Traits in Rice Using Supervised Machine Learning
This research is the Final Year Project for my BSc in Bioinformatics. For this research, I will be looking at machine learning-based predictive model in classifying genes that are related to abiotic stress-resistant traits in rice.<br/><br/>

**Research Aim and Objective**<br/>
The aim of this study is to establish the predictive model for the classification of genes associated with abiotic stress-resistant traits in rice. Inline with this, there are 3 specific objectives which are:
- To construct a training dataset.
- To develop a supervised machine learning-based predictive model.
- To validate the accuracy and efficiency of the predictive models.<br/><br/>

Rice (*Oryza sativa*) data will be collected from MARDI as well as public databases, knowledge sources, and scientific literature.<br/><br/>

**Proposed Solution/Methodology**
- Predictive models will be constructed using supervised learning. Random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression will be studied in this project.
- The predictive models' accuracy will be measured using metrics such as Classification Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Area Under Curve (AUC).<br/><br/>

**Research Significances**
- The ML framework is highly valuable for biologists, geneticists, rice breeders as well as agriculture sectors for the development of new and improved rice varieties.
- It will assist in resource optimization and cost reduction in the field of selection-assisted reproduction (MAS).
- Genome editing can be utilized through the development of a one-stop digital platform.
